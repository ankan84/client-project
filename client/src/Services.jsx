  desc="UX design is the process used to determine what the experience will be like when a user interacts with your product. UX requires a deep understanding of the user: their needs, wants, behaviours, and the context in which they will use a product. Before our clients (and we) understood the value of user-centered design, we made design decisions based on just two things: what we thought was awesome and what the client wanted to see."
